# DCT_Image_Compression
Write a Python function that does the following:
1- Computes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of a gray-scale image
2- Discards coefficients with magnitude <10
3- Computes the inverse DCT of the modified coefficients
4- Computes the root-mean-square error between the reconstructed image and the original image.
Examine the output of the function when applied to the “cameraman.tif” image.
